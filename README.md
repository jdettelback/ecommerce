# E-Commerce Site

## Description
This README describes an e-commerce website that uses an express.js API interacting with a MySQL database through Sequelize. 

## Installation
This application is not deployed but its functionality can be seen in the walkthrough video linked below.

## Usage
This application uses an Express.js back end to connect to a MySQL database containing 3 tables: Category, Product and Tag.  The video shows the schema and seeds being added to the program. The functionality of the program is demonstrated using Insomnia. The walkthrough demonstrates the GET routes for each of the 3 tables, showing how to get all the items and how to get an individual item.  It then shows how to POST to each of the tables. The video then shows how to change an item's information using PUT routes.  Finally, it shows that an item can be deleted from each table.
